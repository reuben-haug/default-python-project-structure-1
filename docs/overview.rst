Goal of the Project
-------------------

The goal of this project is to provide a default Python project structure template that can be used for Agile Python projects, particularly for personal portfolio projects. This template aims to streamline the setup process and ensure consistency across different projects.

Intended Audience
-----------------

This template is intended for Python developers who want to quickly set up a new project with a well-organized folder structure and essential configuration files. It is especially useful for those who are working on personal portfolio projects and want to follow best practices in project organization.

Folder Structure
----------------

The provided folder structure is designed to accommodate various aspects of a Python project, including source code, tests, documentation, and more. Here is an overview of the folder structure and its purpose:

- `docs/`: Contains Sphinx documentation for the project.
- `notebook/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and experimentation.
- `src/`: Contains the main source code of the project.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases for the project.
- `lib/`: Contains additional libraries or modules used by the project.
- `data/`: Contains data files used by the project.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for various tasks, such as data processing or deployment.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the project.
- `bin/`: Contains executable scripts or binaries.
- `assets/`: Contains static assets, such as images or stylesheets.
